# raspi-hq-cam

Simple set of scripts to run Raspberry Pi high quality camera using 4 different buttons

This is mostly using slightly customized picamera python module documentation along with a systemd unit file and GPIO functionality on RPi4 in order to map the buttons on Adafruit display to the Raspberry Pi high quality camera functionality.

The core functionality currently is

  -  take a photo
  -  take a video
  -  preview mode
  -  timelapse mode

You can see what the camera looks like, as well as examples of photos and videos taken on my instragram @theodore_dream https://www.instagram.com/theodore_dream/
